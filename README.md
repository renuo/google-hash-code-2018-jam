# Google Hashcode 2018 Preparation

With this collection of Ruby code we solve the problem of Google Hashcode 2014 (Streetview): https://hashcode.withgoogle.com/2014/tasks/hashcode2014_final_task.pdf

## Try it

We wrote it in 3h with two people on Cloud9: https://ide.c9.io/coorasse/google-hash-code-2014

## Strategy

Each car is on its own and chooses random streets which were not visited yet. This gives us a score around 1'000'000 dependent on how lucky we are. At least we wouldn't be last: https://sites.google.com/site/hashcode2014/results ;-)
